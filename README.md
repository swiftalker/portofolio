This is the v2 version of my portfolio. The updates include:

- A refreshed and visually appealing design
- Addition of a blog feature
- Upgrade to Next.js 13
- Migration of folder routing from pages to app
- Inclusion of several new projects
- Replace javascript to typescript

Perhaps in the next version, I will release:

- Dark mode
