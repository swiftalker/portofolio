# Welcome To My Portofolio!

This marks my first blog post on this website, dedicated to showcasing my portfolio. The content will revolve around my regularly published blogs, the projects I have undertaken, and the skills I have mastered, along with the duration of my experience with various tools, programming languages, and frameworks.

Allow me to introduce myself briefly. I embarked on my programming journey in 2018 and delved into freelancing in 2020. Starting with PHP, I progressed through frameworks like Codeigniter and eventually mastered Laravel, which remains a stronghold in my skill set. I find immense fascination in various realms of computer science, ranging from web programming, mathematics, backend and frontend development, machine learning, to security, and much more!

Presently, my keen interest lies in low-level languages such as Zig, C, Rust, and C++. I believe understanding these languages enhances my comprehension of computers. Additionally, Elixir has captured my attention due to its similarities to Ruby or Python, coupled with outstanding performance and resilience. Perhaps in the future, I'll share my experiences experimenting with Elixir here. That sums up a snippet of my programming career journey.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates and insights into my programming endeavors!
